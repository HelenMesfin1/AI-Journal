#Week 1:
These past 2 weeks of class I haven't needed to use AI for any of my assignments. A lot of what we have been working on so far are
basic python concepts that I learned during INST126. I also didn't have any questions about any of the coding concepts in this week's excerise 
so there was no need to consult AI. 

#Week 2:
I was having trouble detecting a bug in three lines of my code so I used Chatgpt to help me understand where my error was.


#Week 3:
I was having trouble coding question 23 on the hw and asked chatgpt for to show me some examples of how to go about coding.


#Week 4:
I was having trouble with question 10 on the hw. There seemed to be a bug in my code and I wasn't able to figure out what was wrong with it. 
so I used chatgpt to help breakdown each line of code to help me find it.
