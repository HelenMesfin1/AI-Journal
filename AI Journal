#Week 1:
These past 2 weeks of class I haven't needed to use AI for any of my assignments. A lot of what we have been working on so far are
basic python concepts that I learned during INST126. I also didn't have any questions about any of the coding concepts in this week's excerise 
so there was no need to consult AI. 

#Week 2:
I was having trouble detecting a bug in three lines of my code so I used Chatgpt to help me understand where my error was.


#Week 3:
I was having trouble coding question 23 on the hw and asked chatgpt for to show me some examples of how to go about coding.


#Week 4:
I was having trouble with question 10 on the hw. There seemed to be a bug in my code and I wasn't able to figure out what was wrong with it. 
so I used chatgpt to help breakdown each line of code to help me find it. 


#Week 5: 
For my artwork tagging system, I designed the main functions add_tag, search_artworks, sort_artworks, and group_by. I used AI 
briefly to help rebug some of my function code which I then reviewed, tested, and modified to handle real cases like 
duplicate tags and missing search results. 

#Week 6:
I was having trouble with question 9 and 15 on the hw and asked chatgpt to give me code that would apply to a similar sitution and used 
what was provided to help me answer the questions. 


#Week 7:
This week I experimented with Chatgpt and GitHub Copilot to help generate test cases and debug Python code for my project. This really helped 
me catch a potential bug where data outside the valid calendar range were being accepted. Copilot worked well for in line quick syntax fixes.
