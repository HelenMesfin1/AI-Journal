#Week 1:
These past 2 weeks of class I haven't needed to use AI for any of my assignments. A lot of what we have been working on so far are
basic python concepts that I learned during INST126. I also didn't have any questions about any of the coding concepts in this week's excerise 
so there was no need to consult AI.
